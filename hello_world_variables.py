# To print the phrase "Hello World", use the following syntax:
print("Hello World")        # prints "Hello World"

# The "+" symbol can join text together.  Note the empty space below:
print("Hello " + "World")   # prints "Hello World"

# Numbers can also be printed:
print(7)                    # prints "7"
print(7 + 3)                # prints "10"

# To store the text "10" and assign a variable "x" to it, use the following syntax:
x = "10"                    # assigns x to be the STRING "10"
print(x)                    # prints "10"
print(x + " dogs")          # prints ?
# print(x + 8)              # prints ?

# To store the number 10 and assign a variable "x" to it, use the following syntax:
x = 10                      # assigns x to be the NUMBER 10
print(x)                    # ALSO prints "10"
# print(x + " dogs")        # prints ?
print(x + 8)                # prints ?
