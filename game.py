# Our goal through these sections will be to make a magic number guessing game.
# The user will be able to play a game where a secret integer between 1 and 20 (inclusive) is randomly chosen.
# The user will guess a number, and the game will let the user know whether their guess is too low or too high.
# This will continue until the guess is correct, when the game will let the user know they've won, and then exit.

# Part 1: Create a secret number in the code between 1 and 20 (inclusive).  Prompt the user for a guess, and then print whether user's guess and the actual secret number are the same.
# Part 2: Alter Part 1 to print whether the user's guess is higher, lower, or the same as the secret number instead of the actual numbers and difference.
# Part 3: Alter Part 2 to repeat until the user's guess is the same as the secret number, then congratulate the user, and exit.
# Part 4: Alter Part 3 to use a random number between 1 and 20 (inclusive) instead of a entering it into the code manually.

# Congratulations!  You have made your first game!
