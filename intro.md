- 2 Types of Knowledge: Declarative vs Imperative
    - **Declarative**: Describes the world; states a fact.
    - **Imperative**: Describes how to do something, the process
- Most of math is **declarative**, but programming is largely **imperative**.
- A program shares more in common with a recipe than pure mathematics.
