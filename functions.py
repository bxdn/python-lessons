# To define a piece of reusable code, create a function using the 'def' keyword
def my_function():          # defines a function called 'my_function' that prints the number 6 followed by the number 7
    print(6)    
    print(7)

# To use the function (also called CALLING the function), use the name like a variable, but add () to the end of the name.
my_function()               # CALLS my_function, running the code inside it
my_function()               # twice, printing 6, then 7, then 6, then 7
